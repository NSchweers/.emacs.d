* What should a package config system do or not do?

- No central package list should be needed
- Install packages on boot, not lazily (or have an option)
- Run some code per package, before /and/ after installation
- HAVE NO SIDE EFFECTS ON EXPANSION TIME!!!

* What /might/ a package config system also do?

- Specify dependencies on features/files/whatever, to determine evaluation order.
